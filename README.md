## To be done in the nearest future

* Dialogs
    * line up ux and design to match overall look and feel
    * potentially move roll dialog to a FormApp to allow for more robust dice pool builiding 

* Link conditions on sheet and status icons on the character sheet (adding a status from the token toggels it on the sheet and visa versa)

* CSS optimization - convert current CSS structure to LESS based pre-processor for future ease of adjustment
